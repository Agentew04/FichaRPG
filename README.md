# RPG Helper

## Description

This app was designed to assist both Players and Game masters in the creation and the playing of Role Playing Games(RPGs)

## Features

The current version of the application includes a integrated dice-roller and a form to store:

* Basic info(Name, Class, etc)
* Backpack/Inventory
* Experience and level
* Skill points distribution
* Life/Maximum Life
* Gold/Custom currency

In addition, it also has a custom menu for Master to customize all the naming on the app, level progression(custom, arithmetic and geometric progression) and level-up rewards!

## Saving

The app saves all the data from the user in a `config.json` and it's usually located on the AppData folder. In the future this app will support Android-Windows cross-platform, featuring cloud saves.

## Future roadmap

* ~~As soon as WinUI 3 apps becomes available in unpackaged apps(Q4 2021), the app will be ported due to many things being harder to do in UWP.~~ It's here!!
* Add full customization for game masters(both by GUI and directly the `.json` file
* Add multiple language support(Community translations are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Agentew04/RPGHelper/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more)
