## How to Contribute to the Project

If you are already familiar with Git and Github, you probably know what a fork and a pull request is and if you don't, read 
[this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#about-forking) and [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

### Issues

Found a problem but don't know/want to fix it yourself? Just create a issue [here](https://github.com/Agentew04/RPGHelper/issues). And if you don't really know how to
start writing or what to include you can just use one of the pre made templates and fill the information you have. Any additional information you can write at the bottom and I
will take it in consideration when analyzing your problem.

### Pull requests

To add your own changes in the main repository you should fork the repository, make your changes and create a pull 
request saying the things you changed. Don't forget to test your version of the app before submitting!

If you is still editing your fork but want to already create a pull request to let me know you are interested in contributing, just write `[NOT READY]` in the title and I will wait until
it is ready to go!

### Obsevation

Please be respectful with everyone! We are all the same, all humans :)
